# Network Services Interface Path Computation Engine (NSI-PCE)The NSI-PCE is a conglomeration of components from the NSI 2.0 series of specifications [OGF NSF]:* PCE Core - provides a RESTful interface for requesting path resolution within a network of NSI Connection Service enabled domains.  It also utilizes the Spring Framework to provide an infrastructure for pluggable path computation algorithms, allowing users to incorporate their own path computation algorithms into the PCE.* NSI Topology Service – provides an NSI Topology Representation [OGF NSI-TS] compliant service with an independent RESTful interface giving access to discovered network topology.* NSI DDS – A full implementation of the proposed NSI Document Discover Service [OGF NSI-DS] with backwards-compatible support for dynamic discovery of  both A-GOLE and Gang-of-Three (Gof3) topology.![Image of PCE](http:// https://github.com/BandwidthOnDemand/nsi-pce/images/pce.png)# References[OGF NSF] Guy Roberts, et al. “OGF Network Service Framework v2.0”, Group Working Draft (GWD), candidate Recommendation Proposed (R-P), January 28, 2014.
